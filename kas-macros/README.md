KAS Macros
========

This is a sub-library of KAS containing its procedural macros, and exists
solely because procedural macros must current be in a dedicated crate.

Users are advised not to depend on this library directly, but instead rely on
the main KAS lib, which re-exports these macros in its API.


Stable vs nightly
-----------------

This crate is compatible with **stable rustc**, however, usage of **nightly**
has some benefits:

-   More macro diagnostics are emitted, resulting in better error messages
    (without this, some errors may not even be reported)
