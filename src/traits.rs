/// Trait to describe the type needed by the layout implementation.
///
/// The (non-trivial) [`layout`] engines require a storage field within their
/// widget. For manual [`Layout`] implementations this may be specified
/// directly, but to allow the `derive(Widget)` macro to specify the appropriate
/// data type, a widget should include a field of the following form:
/// ```none
/// #[layout_data] layout_data: <Self as kas::LayoutData>::Data,
/// ```
///
/// Ideally we would use an inherent associated type on the struct in question,
/// but until rust-lang#8995 is implemented that is not possible. We also cannot
/// place this associated type on the [`Widget`] trait itself, since then uses
/// of the trait would require parameterisation. Thus, this trait.

/// A widget which escapes its parent's rect
///
/// A pop-up is a special widget drawn either as a layer over the existing
/// window or in a new borderless window. It should be precisely positioned
/// *next to* it's `parent`'s `rect`, in the specified `direction` (or, if not
/// possible, in the opposite direction).
///
/// A pop-up is in some ways an ordinary child widget and in some ways not.
/// The pop-up widget should be a permanent child of its parent, but is not
/// visible until [`Manager::add_popup`] is called.
///
/// A pop-up widget's rect is not contained by its parent, therefore the parent
/// must not call any [`Layout`] methods on the pop-up (whether or not it is
/// visible). The window is responsible for calling these methods.
///
/// Other methods on the pop-up, including event handlers, should be called
/// normally, with one exception: after calling an event handler on the pop-up,
/// the parent should invoke [`Manager::pop_action`] and handle the action
/// itself, where possible (using [`Manager::close_window`] to close it).
/// Remaining actions should be added back to the [`Manager`].
//
// NOTE: it's tempting to include a pointer to the widget here. There are two
// options: (a) an unsafe aliased pointer or (b) Rc<RefCell<dyn WidgetConfig>>.
// Option (a) should work but is an unnecessary performance hack; (b) could in
// theory work but requires adjusting WidgetChildren::get, find etc. to take a
// closure instead of returning a reference, causing *significant* complication.
