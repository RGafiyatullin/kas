//! Drawing APIs
//!
//! Multiple drawing APIs are available. Each has a slightly different purpose.
//!
//! ### High-level themeable interface
//!
//! The [`DrawHandle`] trait and companion [`SizeHandle`] trait provide the
//! highest-level API over themeable widget components. These traits are
//! implemented by a theme defined in `kas-theme` or another crate.
//!
//! ### Medium-level drawing interfaces
//!
//! The [`Draw`] trait and its extensions are provided as the building-blocks
//! used to implement themes, but may also be used directly (as in the `clock`
//! example). These traits allow drawing of simple shapes, mostly in the form of
//! an axis-aligned box or frame with several shading options.
//!
//! The [`Draw`] trait itself contains very little; extension traits
//! [`DrawRounded`], [`DrawShaded`] and [`DrawText`] provide additional draw
//! routines. Toolkits are required to implement only the base [`Draw`] trait,
//! and may provide their own extension traits. For this reason, themes are
//! parameterised over an object `D: Draw + ...` (with specified trait bounds).
//!
//! The medium-level API will be extended in the future to support texturing
//! (not yet supported) and potentially a more comprehensive path-based API
//! (e.g. Lyon).
//!
//! ### Low-level interface
//!
//! There is no universal graphics API, hence none is provided by this crate.
//! Instead, toolkits may provide their own extensions allowing direct access
//! to the host graphics API, for example
//! [`kas-wgpu::draw::CustomPipe`](https://docs.rs/kas-wgpu/*/kas_wgpu/draw/trait.CustomPipe.html).
