/// Interface over a (local) draw object
///
/// A [`Draw`] object is local to a draw context and may be created by the shell
/// or from another [`Draw`] object via upcast/downcast/reborrow.
///
/// Note that this object is little more than a mutable reference to the shell's
/// per-window draw state. As such, it is normal to pass *a new copy* created
/// via [`Draw::reborrow`] as a method argument. (Note that Rust automatically
/// "reborrows" reference types passed as method arguments, but cannot do so
/// (automatically) for methods containing references.)
///
/// This is created over a [`Drawable`] object created by the shell. The
/// [`Drawable`] trait provides a very limited set of draw routines; the shell
/// may implement extension traits such as [`DrawableRounded`],
/// [`DrawableShaded`], or traits defined elsewhere.
///
/// The [`Draw`] object provides a "medium level" interface over known
/// "drawable" traits, for example one may use [`Draw::circle`] when
/// [`DrawableRounded`] is implemented. In other cases one may directly use
/// [`Draw::draw`], passing the result of [`Draw::pass`] as a parameter.
