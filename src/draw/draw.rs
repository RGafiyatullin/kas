///
/// [`DrawT`] and extension traits such as [`DrawRoundedT`] provide draw
/// functionality over this object.
///
/// This type is used to present a unified mid-level draw interface, as
/// available from [`DrawHandle::draw_device`]. A concrete `Draw` object may be
/// obtained via downcast, e.g.:
/// ```ignore
/// # use kas::draw::{Draw, DrawableRounded, DrawableShared, DrawHandle, DrawRoundedT, color::Rgba};
/// # use kas::geom::Rect;
/// # struct CircleWidget<DS> {
/// #     rect: Rect,
/// #     _pd: std::marker::PhantomData<DS>,
/// # }
/// impl CircleWidget {
///     fn draw(&self, draw_handle: &mut dyn DrawHandle) {
///         // This type assumes usage of kas_wgpu without a custom draw pipe:
///         type Draw = Draw<kas_wgpu::draw::DrawPipe<()>>;
///         if let Some(mut draw) = Draw::downcast_from(draw_handle.draw_device()) {
///             draw.circle(self.rect.into(), 0.9, Rgba::BLACK);
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that this object is little more than a mutable reference to the shell's
/// per-window draw state. As such, it is normal to pass *a new copy* created
/// via [`Draw::reborrow`] as a method argument. (Note that Rust automatically
/// "reborrows" reference types passed as method arguments, but cannot do so
/// automatically for structs containing references.)
