/// Base abstraction over drawing
///
/// Unlike [`DrawHandle`], coordinates are specified via a [`Vec2`] and
/// rectangular regions via [`Quad`]. The same coordinate system is used, hence
/// type conversions can be performed with `from` and `into`. Integral
/// coordinates align with pixels, non-integral coordinates may also be used.
///
/// All draw operations may be batched; when drawn primitives overlap, the
/// results are only loosely defined. Draw operations involving transparency
/// should be ordered after those without transparency.
///
/// Draw operations take place over multiple render passes, identified by a
/// handle of type [`Pass`]. In general the user only needs to pass this value
/// into methods as required. [`Draw::add_clip_region`] creates a new [`Pass`].
