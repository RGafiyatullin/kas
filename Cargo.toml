# Use Generic Associated Types (this is too unstable to include in nightly!)

# Use min_specialization (enables accelerator underlining for AccelLabel)

# Enables documentation of APIs for shells and internal usage.
# This API is not intended for use by end-user applications and
# thus is omitted from built documentation by default.
# This flag does not change the API, only built documentation.

# Enables text shaping via HarfBuzz
# Shaping is part of Complex Text Layout, used for ligatures and where form
# depends on position and context (especially important for Arabic).

# Enable Markdown parsing
markdown = ["kas-text/markdown"]

#TODO: once namespaced-features (cargo#5565) and weak-dep-features (cargo#8832)
# are stable, enable this and remove the serde feature requirement under dependencies.winit
# For now, this does work with nightly Cargo and -Z namespaced-features -Z weak-dep-features
