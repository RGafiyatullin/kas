KAS Examples
==========

Exmaples demonstrate various features of KAS.

Note that screenshots may be outdated since themes, draw routines and layout code has been updated quite frequently.

### Gallery

A testbed demoing most widgets along with theme and colour switching.

### Counter

(Almost) the simplest interactive example possible: a counter with push-buttons.

**Variant:** `sync-counter` opens two windows with a synchronised counter.

### Calculator

A simple calculator, with (limited) keyboard support.

### Clock

A simple clock. An example of a custom widget using lower-level draw routines.

### Splitter

Demonstrates resizable panes.

### Hello

A message box.

### Stopwatch

Ready? Set! Go!

### Dynamic

An example with dynamic contents. Doubles as a performance tester for how many
widgets are viable in a window (beyond around 10'000, init/resizing is slow but
interaction is still fast).

### Layout

Demonstration of complex layout setting. Resizing is a little slow due to the
text layout engine (may be improved in the future).

![Layout](../../screenshots/layout.png)

### Markdown

Markdown parsing and rich-text rendering. This is a demonstrator for
[KAS-text](https://github.com/kas-gui/kas-text/)'s rich text support, using
Markdown as an input language. Note that full support for Markdown requires a
considerably more complex text layout engine as well as an HTML parser and
potentially even CSS support; this is beyond the (immediate) goals of this feature.

### Custom theme

An example demonstrating a custom theme implementation.
Pretty useless, but hey, funky background colours!

### Mandlebrot

An example demonstrating a custom draw pipe.

### Async event

Demonstrates how to send data from another thread.

### Cursors

Gallery of available mouse cursors.
